# Nonlinear Mode Decomposition 非线性模态分解
Nonlinear Mode Decomposition (NMD) is a novel noise-robust and adaptive decomposition method which allows reconstruction of full oscillatory modes present in the signal, for any waveform. Moreover, it recovers only physically meaningful oscillations, simultaneously removing the noise. The NMD Toolbox provides all the needed MatLab codes for running NMD, and many more. Just copy all files into some directory in the MatLab path and enjoy; the codes do not require any additional MatLab Toolboxes. If you have any questions/suggestions, please feel free to contact the author at dmytro.iatsenko@gmail.com
